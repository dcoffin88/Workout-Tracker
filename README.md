## What is Workout Tracker?

Workout Tracker is a monthly repeating workout program that I use to track my gym routine. Push, Pull, and Legs days.

---

## The Training Plan: Push, Core/Legs, Pull

Workout Tracker is a **Push → Core/Legs → Pull → Optional** rotation:

- **Push Days** focus on upper-body pushing movements like chest presses and shoulder exercises.
- **Core/Leg Days** hit the entire lower body, ensuring balance and full-body development.
- **Pull Days** target the muscles used in pulling, such as back and biceps.
- **Optional** an extra optional day for body conditioning.
